## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cketiel/BrazilianStocks.git
cd BrazilianStocks
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env1
env1\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don‚Äôt have a `requirements.txt` yet, create one manually:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add your API key

Create a file named `api_key.py` (excluded from Git) and include:

```python
key = "your_alphavantage_api_key_here"
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Example 1: Generate JSON data (daily or weekly)

```bash
python history_to_json.py --t NCRA11 --f d
```

This creates a file like `json/NCRA11_d.json`.

### Example 2: Generate CSVs for multiple stock groups

* Add `.txt` files inside the `ticket_group/` folder (e.g., `1_3.txt`, `2_4.txt`, `random.txt`).
* Each `.txt` file should list one symbol per line.
* Run the script:

```bash
python list_ticket_group.py
```

The output CSVs will be saved in the `csv/` folder as:

```
list_1_3.csv
list_2_4.csv
list_random.csv
master_list.csv
```

---

### Additional Analysis Examples

* **Example 3:** Generate a unified ticket list
* **Example 4:** Generate historical analysis
* **Example 5:** Calculate monthly dividend analysis (`dividend = dividend_amount * cant`)
* **Example 6:** Compute trading balance (`trading = profit - total_dividend`)
* **Example 7:** Track historical total balance (`profit = final_balance - initial_balance`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* The API‚Äôs **free plan** allows 5 API calls per minute and 25 per day.
  The script includes automatic delays to respect this limit.
* Keep your `api_key.py` **private**.
* JSON and CSV outputs are **automatically organized** into folders.

## üíº Estrategia y Uso Pr√°ctico

### üß† Idea Genial

In the Brazilian market, many **Fundos Imobili√°rios (FIIs)** and **stocks** pay **monthly dividends (proventos)**. Each asset distributes on a different date, and to receive the dividend, you must hold the asset for at least **8 days** before its *ex-dividend date*.

The **brilliant idea** behind this system is to **rotate capital** between assets with different payment dates ‚Äî effectively earning **two or more dividends with the same capital** in one month.

**Example workflow:**

1. Hold **Stock A** until it pays its dividend, receive payment, and sell it.
2. Immediately reinvest into **Stock B**, which pays later in the same month.

If the difference between their payment dates is at least 10 days, the investor earns **two sets of proventos** with the same money.

Average dividend yields in Brazil hover around **1% per month**. Using this rotation logic, monthly returns can **double** to approximately **2%**, without adding new capital.

#### üî¢ Key Formulas

| Symbol    | Description             |
| :-------- | :---------------------- |
| **pc**    | Purchase price          |
| **pv**    | Selling price           |
| **g**     | Profit per share        |
| **cant**  | Number of shares        |
| **net**   | Net profit = g √ó cant   |
| **total** | Total value = cant √ó pv |

The **profit condition** is:

```
p‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇ > d‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + c‚ÇÅ + c‚ÇÇ
```

Where:

* **p‚ÇÅ**, **p‚ÇÇ** = dividends from stocks 1 and 2
* **d‚ÇÅ** = drop after Stock 1 payment (if pv‚ÇÅ < pc‚ÇÅ)
* **a‚ÇÇ** = price increase before buying Stock 2
* **c‚ÇÅ**, **c‚ÇÇ** = commissions for selling and buying

---

### üí∞ Commissions and Optimization

Analyze whether commissions (**c‚ÇÅ**, **c‚ÇÇ**) are fixed or vary by broker.
Using **limit orders** instead of market orders can lower costs.
Weekly **rebalancing** via automation (e.g., *grid trading bots* or **Aladdin by BlackRock-inspired algorithms**) ensures disciplined execution.

---

### üìà Portfolio Strategy Overview

Divide assets into **four groups** based on payment timing:

| Group  | Approx. Date | Description         |
| :----- | :----------- | :------------------ |
| **S1** | Day 30       | End-of-month payers |
| **S2** | Day 7        | Early-month payers  |
| **S3** | Day 12       | Mid-month payers    |
| **S4** | Day 17       | Third-week payers   |

üí° **Tip:** Always re-buy quality stocks when they drop below your average cost.

---

### üß≠ Plan General

The **general plan** maintains a weekly reinvestment cycle ensuring continuous income and growth.
Each week, one group generates proventos while another is purchased for the next payout window.

#### üîÅ Core Principles

1. **Weekly Rebalancing** ‚Äî Review which assets to sell and buy weekly.
2. **Continuous Reinvestment** ‚Äî Reinvest dividends into the next group immediately.
3. **Buy the Dip** ‚Äî Re-acquire good assets below average cost.
4. **Automate When Possible** ‚Äî Use bots or scripts for data-driven rotation.

#### üßÆ Reinvestment Windows

| Group  | Last Buy Date | Dividend Period | Objective          |
| :----- | :------------ | :-------------- | :----------------- |
| **S1** | Day 30        | End of month    | Start of rotation  |
| **S2** | Day 7         | Early month     | Early reinvestment |
| **S3** | Day 12        | Mid-month       | Growth phase       |
| **S4** | Day 17        | Third week      | Cycle completion   |

**Minimum capital per group:** 1,000 BRL.

### üîó Combinaciones Estrat√©gicas

While each group operates independently, combining them creates **optimized capital flow** and **continuous reinvestment**.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Combination 1 ‚Äî S1‚ÄìS3

Balances end-of-month and mid-month cycles.
üü¢ Stable income, 2x capital use per month.
üîπ Best for moderate-risk investors.

#### üîÅ Combination 2 ‚Äî S2‚ÄìS4

Bridges early-month and third-week payers.
üü¢ Earn twice monthly, ~10-day gap between cycles.
üîπ Best for active dividend rotators.

#### üß† Combination 3 ‚Äî S1‚ÄìS2‚ÄìS4

Three-stage reinvestment cycle (Day 30 ‚Üí Day 7 ‚Üí Day 17).
üü¢ Near-continuous compounding with 3 payouts per month.
üîπ Best for advanced or automated strategies.

#### üìä Comparative Overview

| Combination  | Avg. Monthly Rotations | Expected Yield Gain | Risk        |
| :----------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :---------- |
| **S1‚ÄìS3**    | 2x                     | +80‚Äì100%            | Low         |
| **S2‚ÄìS4**    | 2x                     | +100‚Äì120%           | Medium      |
| **S1‚ÄìS2‚ÄìS4** | 3x                     | +150‚Äì180%           | Medium‚ÄìHigh |
